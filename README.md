Online tank webgame written in javascript using MongoDB to verify user accounts and leaderboard.  I made this project to experiment with writing my own API's as well as to refine my javascript and create an interactive game.

From postman send a post request to
https://tiny-tanks.herokuapp.com/api/users/score

With The Headers:    
AppToken. :  !@duh!
